When I feel your sweet embrace again
Take me to that special place again
Up high floating on cloud nine with you
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
(I'm yours)
(I'm yours)
I'm yours
Say you'll never leave me
Hold on
Don't ever let me go
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
Your gaze
I'll never lose it
No way
You'll ever be alone
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
When I feel your sweet embrace again
Take me to that special place again
Up high floating on cloud nine with you
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
So lost
I am missing
Your touch
Gives my life meaning
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
Gives my life meaning
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
You are mine
Don't ever let me go
You are mine
You are mine
You'll never be alone
When I feel your sweet embrance again
Take me to that special place again
Up high floating on cloud nine with you
Heaven is when I'm with you
You are mine
You are mine
